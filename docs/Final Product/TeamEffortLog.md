# Rachapol Kanokvilasporn

### Major Contributions:
#### *API integration*
- The calorie ninjas API is what the program relies on to retrieve information about food. Without it, the program would not be able to take in the users' meals.
#### *"Food", "Meal" and "Saving User Nutritional data" classes*
- The food class is what the program uses to store and deliver nutritional data.
- The Meal class houses all the individual food objects as an abstract meal. The class can return data based on it.
- Saving the nutrition data to files is what the program relies on to communicate nutrition data based on the user. It keeps the users' data constantly up to date and is used when making the report.
#### *Base GUI for adding the users' meal/food nutrition data.*
#### *Creating the Linear Regression class*
- Used by Vlad's report generator for the calorie prediction.

## Sprint 5 (University Week 17-18):

Before this sprint, Rachapol had taken the responsibility of making the API and loading the data from it into the program. These tasks we not tracked on jira as it was done during the holiday, but the API had been fully integrated a class in the program just before this sprint. This API and the classes derived using it is one of the backbones of the program which makes it work. 
##

https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201070-97

This task was was to change the way that the data from the API was stored into an object so it could be more easily accessed, moved and changed.

The class which was created is now the "Food objects" that the program uses


## Sprint 6 (University Week 18-21):

### Week 18

#### Create a meal class to house food object datatypes
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201070-98

This task entailed Rachapol making another object to store the food obects in. Suitably called the meal class as it contained all the food objects the user had inputted for a meal. This would then represent the meal and contained its type (Breakfast, Lunch, etc.), and the date it was on.


### Week 19
#### Integrate recent changes into the main program
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201070-101

https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201070-112
This task was to create a method of data retention so that the user could close the program and load it back up with their data intact



## Sprint 7 (University Week 22):

#### Add a global user name, so the application can know which user has currently logged in
(https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201070-124)

This was set and compeleted in Week 22. It took 2 days to complete. This task involved Rachapol adding a global user name, so the application can know which user has currently logged in and do tasks with data stored with the users' name on it. Rachapol also added some QoL features like going back to the menu when you exit the frame.
